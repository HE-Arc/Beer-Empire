# Beer-Empire
Django project, a game where you conquer the world beer by beer.

## Introduction
This project is about the creation of an idle game in wich earn money to improve your empire and to earn even MORE money!

First of all, the player starts with a simple farm, he will need to harvest ressources like wheat, corn, hop and yeast. Those ressources can be sold. With the money aquired the player will be able to buy upgrades for his farm. With enough money, he will be able to buy the brewery where the real game starts.

The brewery will enable the player to brew different type of beers using the farm production to get a high profit. Missions will be given to the player for him to ensure the survival or enrichment of his brewery: Oktoberfest, political assassination (using badly brewed beers).

With enough money, the player's company will be able to access the market. The market will allow the player to buy opponents shops in order to get a world monopoly on beer. It will also allow different players to exchange ressources between each others.

Lastly, it will be possible to unlock a laboratory, in order to research new kind of beers and upgrades.
